          "I had the good fortune to work with Marton for several years on
          several projects. He has a rare ability to design complex, highly
          effective and efficient code that delivers exactly what is needed.
          Even rarer is his ability to communicate effortlessly with everyone;
          coders, scientists and clinicians. He takes the time to understand
          what is needed and then makes it happen, usually giving you solutions
          beyond your dreams. And his work is always comprehensively detailed
          and his software is always a delight to use. Marton's contributions to
          our disease gene discovery and translation projects were vital to our
          successes."

          "Working with Márton was an absolute pleasure. His bioinformatics
          expertise and analytical insight consistently delivered effective
          analyses for our research in a timely manner. He demonstrated
          excellent problem-solving ability and wrote clean, well-documented
          code that was easy to build upon, and effectively displayed results to
          the biology team. He brought not only technical skill but also a
          collaborative spirit and professionalism to our collaborations. I
          highly recommend Márton to anyone looking for a top-tier
          bioinformaticist."

          "I’ve had the privilege of working with Márton Münz over the past five
          years across both academic and startup environments, during which he
          has consistently demonstrated outstanding expertise, professionalism,
          and a deep understanding of our scientific goals. Márton provided
          reliable support for our AWS servers, ensuring they were
          well-maintained, secure, and optimized for our bioinformatics
          workflows. He led multiple RNA-sequencing projects from raw data
          processing through to differential expression analysis, and developed
          a custom online database that seamlessly integrates our gene panels
          with experimental results. Márton consistently delivered high-quality
          work on time and with clear, effective communication. I have no doubt
          that his new consultancy will uphold the same high standards and
          collaborative approach, making him a valuable partner for any future
          client. "

          "We really enjoyed working with Márton in our company. During his time
          supporting our bioinformatics and IT teams, Márton played a crucial
          role in improving our data infrastructure. He swiftly took over
          responsibilities, resolved critical bottlenecks in our sequencing and
          imaging data pipelines, and introduced optimizations that
          significantly improved AWS and Google Drive workflows. His proactive
          identification of a costly S3 logging feedback loop and his thoughtful
          contributions to pipeline troubleshooting, AWS Batch customization,
          and database design were particularly impactful. Beyond his technical
          skill, he was collaborative, dependable, and a real pleasure to work
          with."

          vast knowledge, problem-solving skills, and genuine care for quality
          work sets him apart in the field. During our collaboration, Márton
          consistently demonstrated his ability to tackle complex computational
          and biological challenges with innovative solutions. His expertise was
          particularly valuable when he helped our immuno-oncology team resolve
          issues with a complex Nextflow pipeline on AWS, showcasing his
          versatility and deep understanding of both computational tools and
          biological concepts. Márton's dedication to mentoring, combined with
          his eclectic experience and enthusiasm for new challenges, makes him
          an invaluable asset to any project. His ability to inspire others and

          "I have worked closely with Marton for over 2 years. He is very
          enthusiastic and eager to take on a challenge. We have worked on some
          fairly complicated projects, such as RNA-Seq dose-response analysis,
          and Marton has delivered an excellent report that helped us make sound
          decisions. Marton also has a breadth of experience that goes beyond

          days of the company when we needed to build a database and
          bioinformatics tools to perform dry lab research. As our team was very
          lean and we did not have in-house bioinformatics capabilities, we
          relied heavily on Marton's expertise and advice to execute the
          project. Marton was very responsive, knowledgeable and offered helpful
          suggestions to implement the necessary functions that we required for
          our work. He also ensured that we were able to access and use the
          resources on our own after the project was completed."

          bringing in contractors can be tough. It requires contractors to

          working with Marton for being great at these!"
